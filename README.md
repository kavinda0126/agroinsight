# AgroInsight - Integrated Dynamic Agricultural Information and Guidance System

## Overview

AgroInsight is an innovative solution aimed at providing real-time agricultural information and guidance to farmers, specifically addressing challenges within the traditional agricultural system in Sri Lanka. The system consists of both a **web application** and a **mobile application** to enhance accessibility for farmers.

This project was inspired by limitations identified in the research paper **"AgroPro: Optimizer for Traditional Agricultural System in Sri Lanka"** and seeks to empower farmers by providing tools for crop management, pest and disease control, and more.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Agricultural Data**: Provides up-to-date information on crop management, pest control, and disease management.
- **Pest and Disease Management**: A dedicated section for farmers to record and report unknown diseases and pests affecting their crops.
- **Farmer-Friendly Interfaces**: User-friendly interfaces designed with non-tech-savvy farmers in mind.
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Available as both a web app and a mobile app for broader accessibility.

## Web Application

The **web application** is developed using the **MERN stack**:
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Mobile Application

The **mobile application** is built using **React Native** for cross-platform support:
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js
- **Cloud Storage**: Firebase is used for storing images and data.
  
The mobile app allows farmers to:
- Report unknown pests and diseases
- Access real-time agricultural guidance

## ðŸš€ My Contribution

**I have specifically contributed to the Pest and Disease Management module** of the AgroInsight system. This module allows farmers to:
- Submit complaints about unknown crop diseases and pests
- Store and manage disease records
- Track disease statuses and control methods

**By utilizing Firebase for cloud storage**, we ensure all images and complaints submitted by farmers are safely stored and easily accessible.
